InsaniText
========

This is a text editor I am making for fun, and partly to get better at writing code in Python and Qt.

I am not sure yet what kind of functionality the editor will get over time. At the moment I am using it mainly as my main text editor, which effectively replaced gedit on ubuntu and notepad on windows. 

It is (at this point in time) not meant to be a replacement for my IDEs that I am using when writing code. Though I might try to give it a shot to make this a customized-to-me IDE. 

This text editor might have some quirks, but it is not aimed at a general audience. If you happen to like parts of this editor however, you are free to clone the source code and alter it further to suit your needs. 


## TODO
These features I do want to add to this editor at some point in time, in no particular order:

* Syntax highlighting 
* Preferences menu (adjustable backgroud, font, etc..)
* Menubar options (save, save as, open..)
* Average typing-speed measurement.
